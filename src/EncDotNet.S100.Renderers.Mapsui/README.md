# EncDotNet.S100.Renderers.Mapsui

Rendering of S-100 data into [Mapsui](https://mapsui.com/) map layers with CRS projection.

## Overview

This library bridges the S-100 portrayal pipeline output to Mapsui map layers, including full CRS projection support (EPSG:3857 Web Mercator). Key types include:

- **`MapsuiCoverageRenderer`** — `ICoverageRenderer<ILayer>` implementation that renders coverage data as a georeferenced raster overlay (S-102 / S-104 / S-111).
- **`MapsuiCoverageArrowRenderer`** — renders current arrows (e.g. from S-111 data) as a georeferenced raster layer.
- **`MapsuiDisplayListRenderer`** — product-agnostic vector renderer that consumes a list of `DrawingInstruction`s plus an `IFeatureGeometryProvider` and produces a `MemoryLayer` of styled point/line/area/text features. Used by every S-100 vector product (S-101, S-124, S-129, S-421); no per-spec subclass is required.
- **`ProjNetCrsTransformFactory`** — `ICrsTransformFactory` implementation using [ProjNet](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/ProjNet4GeoAPI) for coordinate transformations between UTM, WGS84, and Web Mercator.

`MapsuiDisplayListRenderer` honours the relevant S-100 Part 9 conventions:

- Pen widths and text/symbol offsets specified in millimetres on the nominal display surface are converted to screen pixels using the standard `1 px = 0.32 mm` ratio (S-100 Part 9 §3.10.4).
- `<foreground>` / `<background>` colours accept either a palette token or a literal `#RRGGBB` / `RRGGBBAA` hex value, with the optional `transparency` attribute applied as alpha attenuation.
- Text alignment, mm offsets, and `textLine` start/end offsets (Relative or Absolute) are honoured per S-100 Part 9 §11.4.
- `LineStyleProvider`, `SymbolProvider`, and `AreaFillProvider` callbacks let the host project plug in a portrayal catalogue without coupling the renderer to a specific dataset library.

### Sharing processed-SVG and pattern-tile work across renders

`MapsuiDisplayListRenderer` resolves SVG symbols and rasterises area-fill pattern tiles lazily on first reference. The processed-SVG output depends on the active `ColorPalette` (fill/stroke colours are recoloured against the palette), and pattern-tile rasterisation is comparatively expensive.

When a single dataset is re-rendered repeatedly — typical when toggling palettes, scrubbing time-steps, or changing mariner settings — assign a single `MapsuiRenderAssetCache` instance to the renderer's `AssetCache` property on every `Render()` call:

```csharp
private readonly MapsuiRenderAssetCache _renderAssetCache = new();

// per Render():
var renderer = new MapsuiDisplayListRenderer
{
    Palette = palette,
    AssetCache = _renderAssetCache,
    SymbolProvider = name => catalogue.GetSymbol(name).SvgContent,
    AreaFillProvider = name => catalogue.GetAreaFill(name),
};
```

The cache segments entries per palette (`Day` / `Dusk` / `Night`) so flipping back and forth keeps every palette warm. When `AssetCache` is unset, the renderer falls back to a per-instance cache, which preserves legacy behaviour for ad-hoc / one-shot callers.

## Installation

```sh
dotnet add package EncDotNet.S100.Renderers.Mapsui
